# Melvor Mastery Calculator

## Mastery
- Load game save & select skill to show current mastery levels.
- Select an item to simulate leveling to desired level.
- Assumptions:
  - Player has unlocked everything to decrease action interval to lowest level.
  - Player has highest preservation setup except for no charge stone of Rhaelyx.

## Probability
- Check drop rate probability of items to see how lucky/unlucky you actually are.
- Can enter drop chance manually or select monster/item from menus to get drop chance.

## Bank Analyzer
- I plan on holding every item in the game in my inventory at some point, so this checks the game save and shows items still missing from your bank.
